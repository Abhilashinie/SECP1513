| 1 | Assignment 1/Poster | The talk showed me that there are lots of different jobs in technology, not just the technical stuff. They talked about how being good with people, adapting to changes, and always learning new things are also important. The stories about people changing their jobs were really cool and made me realize how being flexible is crucial in tech. What got to me the most was when they talked about doing technology stuff responsibly, especially in AI. The talk made me feel good about tech jobs, saying you need a mix of skills, keep learning, and always think about doing things right. It was a really interesting and encouraging talk. |
| 2 | Assignment 2/Video | Going to UTM Digital on our trip felt like entering a whole new world of jobs and places where people work. Walking around, I saw that each job had its own special place to work. Looking at how they take care of the servers was really interesting, especially with all the super good security. also when trying out the video editing and learning how to add voices was a very intersting experiance. This trip didnt only made me understand more about the jobs in this industry but also let me see what it's really like to work in the digital world. It was a really cool experience that I won't forget. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IVisN_ALiEAAHjA8WdJEZhuVKMzCNbvP/view?usp=sharing        (our group's video)|
| 3 | Assignment 3/Report | Listening to this talk gave me a peek into what it's like to be a system developer, and what stood out to me was how much you can learn by actually doing things. The talk talked a lot about working together as a team and how important it is to have a culture where everyone helps each other to reach the same goals. They also talked about talking openly with each other, which helps in understanding different points of view and making things go smoothly. The speaker made it clear that being able to adapt to different situations is super important for long-term success. It made me realize how following these ideas can really shape a successful career in system development. |
| 4 | Assignment 4/Newsletter | Going to Clarity Techworks was super cool for me. I got to check out the different parts of the company, and each one has a really important job. I was really interested in the teams that work on making apps for Android and iOS. They're super focused on making really good apps and fixing any problems. The way the QA team works with everyone else is pretty amazing â€“ it shows how much the company cares about making great products. The people in the UI/UX department are really creative, and they help make the company's products and social media look awesome. I also learned about the API department and how they make sure different apps can talk to each other smoothly. The visit made me see how all these different teams work really well together.|
| 5 | Quiz/PC Assemble | Building a PC in our session was so cool for me. It really stuck with me. Doing it for real made me understand computer hardware better, and now I feel more confident with all those parts. Putting the PC together from the beginning, making sure every piece was in the right place, showed me how the stuff we learn in class actually works. It wasn't just theory anymore; it was real. This experience not only made me better at the technical side but also let me use teamwork in a real situation. It's one of those things in my school journey that made everything feel more real and much more interesting.|
