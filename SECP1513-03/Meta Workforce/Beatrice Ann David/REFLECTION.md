Reflection:


Assigment 1 (Format: Poster):   

Through this assignment, I learn how to work in team and compromise certain things to finish this assignment 
                                assignment succesfully. Not only that, I also learn many information about Clarity Techworks company and 
                                the people who have been working in there. They share their life and work experiences and gave us some life-
                                changing advice. For example, Izzah Fatini binti Mohd Nasr, one of the UI/UX design department said that you 
                                need to learn from your mistakes and continuously learning new skills. This marks the first industry talk.


Assignment 2 (Format: Video):

Through this assignment, I learn how to make a video with my teammates. The support they gave is immeasurable. I have learned a lot of 
information about UTM digital. The facilities and the services they offered to the students in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). 
In the huge UTM digital building, they have UTM Digital Care Unit that students can receive assistance from regarding their student 
account at UTM. This amazes me a lot as now I know where to go if I encountered such issue. This marks the first industrial visit.


Assignment 3 (Format: Report)

Through this assignment, I have learnt on how to make an interactive and yet a formal report with one of my team member, Amr. In the 
report, both of us have shared what we have learnt and ours and the other team members' reflection regarding Industrial talk 2.
Personally, I have learnt many things Credence A TM's company and their system development. What interests me the most is the vision of this 
company which is to help their customers or users in getting a good boost for their digital bussiness. Their dedication and hardworking
should be rewarded. 


Assignment 4 (Format:  Technical Paper IEEE Format)

Through this assignment, my team members have made a newsletter regarding our industrial visit to Clarity Techworks. At the company
that is located at Sunway Big Box, I was amazed how huge and clean the building was. The computers there appears to be new and they even 
have one day in a month where the people who are working there will have a blast by playing games (like a resting day) where no work
is allowed. How cool is that! I also got to know how the CEO got into IT in the first place. Apparently, he was just 11 when he receive 
his call to pursue IT. 


Lab (PC ASSEMBLE):

I have learnt how to assemble and reassemble computer components such as RAM (Random Access Memory) and cables. It was pretty challenging 
at first but thanks to my teammates, they were very postive and helpful that we managed to finish this lab in time. Overall, I find it 
interesting and fun.


Design thinking Project (Prototype):

All thanks to my teammates that we managed to finish our prototype in time, with Jin Yie's, one of my teammates amazing drawing skills and 
Mustafa's ideas and also the others, we've managed to draw a perfect prototype and interview a businesswoman. While Mustafa and I were collecting
data from people around us that are using online clothing platforms via google form. It was a fun and challenging experience overall.


Design thinking Project (Report):

Once again thanks to all my teammates for their undivided support in finishing this report. I have learned how to write a formal report
and analyse data in order to write the summary that has been written in this report. I have also learned how to divide tasks among my 
team members and support them and work together.
