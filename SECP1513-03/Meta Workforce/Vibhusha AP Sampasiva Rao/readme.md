  When I think back on Assignment 1, I realised how valuable and insightful the process of making a poster based on Clarity Techworks' industrial talk was. A practical understanding of all aspects of technology was made possible by the chance to learn about the company's history and the range of job scopes within the tech industry, including web development, QA testing analysis, Android development, and UI/UX design. It was especially instructive to hear how important it is to have a broad skill set, responsibility, good communication, and timely task completion in order to succeed in these fields. I could relate to the quote "If you fail, dare enough to rise again" and found constant motivation in it.Taking on the poster design task gave me a sense of accomplishment in meeting my group members' expectations as well as giving me the opportunity to learn new skills.

  In addition, the experience made me realise how important it is to collaborate and communicate well in a team environment. Making the poster helped me develop my creative abilities and my comprehension of the subject matter, both of which I think will be helpful in my future undertakings. The poster's favourable reception by my peers served as more evidence of the importance of effective visual communication. In summary, this task not only expanded my understanding of diverse technology fields but also highlighted the significance of flexibility, continuous learning, and perseverance in the ever evolving field of technology.

   The visit to University Technology Malaysia's digital services department, UTM DIGITAL, was an amazing experience that gave me important insights into the fields of data management and ICT security.  Data security is crucial in today's digital world, as proven by the strict security measures, which include forbidding cell phone use in the data centre and the UTM Data Center's ANSI/TIA-942:2017 certification.The exposure to UTM's innovative cybersecurity initiatives and the emphasis on the vital nature of data in the modern technological landscape, as a student specialising in network and data security, reinforced the significance of data security.
   
   It also created a sense of accountability for improving data security within the larger national framework in addition to the educational setting. In addition to broadening my knowledge, the visit to UTM DIGITAL reinforced the critical role that data security plays in the rapidly changing field of information and communication technology.

  The industrial talk about the new cloud and digital services company from Credence TM gave insightful information about the fast-paced field of system development. Comprehending the organisation's dedication to providing inventive and useful resolutions emphasised the significance of remaining up-to-date with developing technologies. In addition to explaining possible career paths in analytics, the talk provided insight into Credence's workplace culture and emphasised the value of proactive engagement in encouraging the growth of knowledge and professional networks within the technology sector. As I understand that gaining the confidence of higher officials is necessary for opportunities in the future, I am also more conscious of the strategic significance of consistently delivering results. 
  
  The dedication to learning about the tools used by the technical teams brought to light how important it is to keep up with the constantly changing world of technology. I am excited to become an outstanding system developer as I start the next four years. My approach calls for actively participating in networking and ongoing education, looking for ways to gain our technical team's trust through reliable work, and keeping up with the newest tools and technologies available. The key to developing my abilities and becoming a skilled and professional member of the field will be to make major contributions to projects and work towards a thorough understanding of system development processes.

   The Clarity Techwork Company industrial visit gave us an in-depth knowledge of the technology sector. The thorough descriptions of the job responsibilities, which included web, iOS, and Android development, APIs, and UI/UX design, provided a thorough understanding of what the company does. The use of easy apps and coding to clearly illustrate each department's duties was a significant technique. In addition to making the material easier to understand, this practical approach promoted an active learning environment. Additionally, the staff interaction pointed out the need for consistent performance and the importance of having strong communication skills in addition to technical proficiency. 
   
   The company's vibrant and enthusiastic work culture has established a standard for the kind of formal environment I hope to work in in the future. The industrial visit was a memorable and worthwhile experience since it not only increased my understanding of the tech sector but also gave me a chance to enjoy spending time with my classmates.

## PC Assemble
The PC assembly session was a valuable educational experience that gave students an in-depth knowledge of a computer's internal parts. In addition to learning about the different components of the CPU through the hands-on exercise, we also acquired useful knowledge about assembling the system together and disassembling it. Our learning was greatly helped by the staff's assistance and direction, who carefully guided us through the assembly process. The post-session quiz was a useful tool for assessing our understanding and reinforcing the information we had learned. The session, which served as the Technology Information System course's first assignment, was both educational and entertaining and it laid a solid foundation for the real-world application of theoretical concepts.

Moreover, collaborating with my teammates during the disassembly and assembly process helped to develop a sense of unity and cooperation.  This practical experience not only helped to clarify the internal workings of a computer, but it also highlighted the value of applied learning to support theoretical understanding. Overall, the PC assembly session was a promising start to the course and provided an important introduction to the practical aspects of technology.

## Design Thinking- AR technology in Online Selling Platform
[Design Thinking - Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/117IhoaAheWX2tGqEhUSp0cY9mGeq4p00/view?usp=sharing)

Participating in the Low Fidelity Prototype Design Thinking process was an unforgettable adventure that took place in five phases: Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test, and Empathy. As the person assigned with conducting a thorough interview with a client who works in the online clothing retail sector, I recognised their difficulties, especially the high percentage of returns brought on by unhappy clients. A turning point was when it became clear that adding Augmented Reality (AR) technology to the online platform could improve the user experience and possibly change the entire industry.

Working together with my group members, we started creating a human-centered website prototype that was straightforward but functional for the online selling platform. Our lecturer, Muhammad Iqbal Tariq, gave us step-by-step instructions that required us to give every phase our complete attention, resulting in a thorough and purposeful project execution. Our thoughtful project arranging gave us plenty of time to explore the complicated processes of problem-solving and prototype development.

Personally, I had a great time coming up with the idea and creating the website prototype. It improved my knowledge of the Design Thinking process and sharpened my ability to suggest solutions and build prototypes for various applications. As a student of computer science, I understand how important it is to grasp this strategy because it gives me useful tools to tackle challenging problems.

My involvement in the client interview was especially educational since it gave me knowledge about how to conduct expert client interviews as well as understand the expectations and worries of the clients. Overall, the project demonstrated how critical it is to approach problem-solving from a human-centered perspective and how Design Thinking can act as a catalyst for the development of creative solutions. I now have a deep respect for the iterative and compassionate style of the design process, and this experience has motivated me to apply these ideas to all of my future endeavours.
