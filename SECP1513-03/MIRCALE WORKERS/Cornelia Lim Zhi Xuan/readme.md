All in all, this industrial talk was beneficial for me as I had learnt that a good attitude was indeed the key trait to help us solve any problems in my daily life and work life.

3/Report	Industrial Talk	Throughout this industrial talk by Ms.Qistina, I gained insight into a career in analytics such as a data scientist. Some processes like data collection, data transformation, modelling and virtualization must be undergone to examine large sets of data. It also made me realize that it was important to learn some technologies in databases and master programming languages. However, the eagerness to learn a piece of new knowledge is the most precious trait. With this trait, we will not easily give up when facing obstacles.

Once again, I noticed that the collaboration between each department was truly important in a company. Each of them played their role in creating a good and secure system or application.
5	PC Assemble & Quiz	Throughout this PC Assemble, it helped me to recognize the components of the PC. Besides, I was able to collaborate with my group members to assemble and reassemble the PC. The PC Assemble quiz also helped me apply my learned knowledge on paper.

6	Design Thinking (Low-Fidelity Prototype)	Throughout this design thinking, I found that it is an ideal methodology used in product design and problem-solving in complex systems. By following the five stages which are empathizing, defining, ideating prototypes and testing, we were able to solve the problems by fulfilling the satisfaction of our target client. Besides, it also helped me to train my skills like collaboration skills, communication skills and problem-solving skills. I also realized we must be responsible for our given tasks. All in all, I gained lots of experience from it.
