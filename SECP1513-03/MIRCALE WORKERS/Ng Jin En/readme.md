| 1 | Assignment 1/Poster | Based on the exciting talk by Clarity Techworks Sdn.Bhd, I had gained the information, deeper understanding and further knowledge on future career. The speaker introduces the overview of the Information Technology sector especially in fintech. Furthermore, the talk also makes me realise the lack of fundamental knowledge in the job such as web developer, UI/UX designer and Android and IOS developer. In sum, I would always improve myself by pursuing more knowledge in programming and sharpening my communication skills to become a successful network engineer in the future. | 
| 2 | Assignment 2/Video |This UTMDigital industrial visit offered me a great opportunity to learn about data management and digital services in UTM. Experiencing the real working environment enhanced my understanding of information systems and tech applications in organizational contexts. Exploring UTM Digital Care showcased practical aspects of customer access and engagement. Discussion rooms highlighted collaborative spaces, fostering creativity and effective communication. The visit to UTM Data Centre offered insights into managing physical servers, underlining their critical role.  Witnessing technological innovations in action provides valuable insights for our future careers. This has grown a great interest inside of me. | 
| 3 | Assignment 3/Report | Based on this industrial talk, I have gained a clear picture into the workings of a computing company dedicated to the growth of cloud and digital services analytics. According to Ms. Qistina Batrisyia binti Azman Shah, the learning process is the most critical path, especially when we are introduced to a new technology. Through this talk, I clearly know the challenges face by a system developer. In conclusion,  Credence Systems Corporation's system development path has influenced my understanding of how technology and analytics are intertwined. Thus, people can use the Credence System to enter the unknown world of the metaverse and explore the unknown.| 
| 4 | Assignment 4/Newsletter | We can say that we are proud of it as we have been given this golden opportunity to widen our horizons and learn some new things by joining this industry visit to Clarity Techworks Sdn.Bhd which had been organized by the Faculty of Computing @ UTM for the year 1 network and security student. From the visit to Clarity Techworks Sdn. Bhd., I had learned about certain cutting-edge technologies that are not covered in our curriculum and deepened our knowledge of the ICT sector. For example, the knowledge about quality assurance (QA), user interface and user experience design (UI/UX), web development and Android and IOS development. These jobs can make life more interesting and fulfilling by solving problems in the ICT sector, making society safer and allowing people to live productive lives. To put it in a nutshell, the most significant advantage we derived from this industry discussion is that it provided us with some inspiration and information for our future careers. |
| 5 | Quiz/PC Assemble |By doing PC assembly, I learned about tools used for assembling computer parts, parts of the motherboard, the uses of cable in the motherboard and steps in PC assembly. PC assembly is useful for recycling old or used computer parts and changing internal parts of the computer. In my point of view, PC assembly is a fundamental skill that necessary for every computer science student.  |
| 6 | Design Thinking (Low-Fidelity Prototype) | The design thinking prototype is highly beneficial as it enables me to explore the convergence of technology in both physical objects and software. This design thinking project has inspired me to create more applications or new technologies that would bring the public a better day and help people to complete their tasks in daily life.  |
