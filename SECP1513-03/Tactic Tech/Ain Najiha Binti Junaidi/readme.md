| 4 | Assignment 4 (Newsletter) | From the Clarity Techwork visit, I learned several things about their operations that use blockchain technology to empower businesses. The way they demonstrated the system development process was really impressive. I also admire how they depict the relationships among all of the employees and the significance of each position in the company. Moreover, I learned the tools and technologies that they employ to properly administer and manage the system. Overall, this visit was such a big opportunity for me to motivate and encourage myself to pursue IT and networking in the future. |
