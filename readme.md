| Course Synopsis  | As a primer subject, this course will introduce students to information systems and technology (IS/IT) and its uses at home and work. Various aspects of IS/IT encompassing hardware, software, network, and communications will be introduced. Students will be equipped with basic skills in handling PC installation and productivity tools via practical work in the labs, which shall comprise a major part of the study. This class also conducts industry visits and talks as a part of work-based learning. Both industry visits and talks will expose students to a real working environment, get knowledge from the industry, and increase engagement between university and industry. The student also needs to briefly explore the requirements and job specifications for a career in IT. |

| 2   | Project-based learning | Each student is required to complete his/her own e-portfolio. The purpose of this project is to enable students to collect all evidence of his/her learning journey over time during study in UTM. This would be a great benefit to the students when they apply for jobs after graduating from the university and as a part of lifelong learning. |
| 3   | Industry visit         | Industry visit is an approach of work-based learning and is a part of NALI (New Academic Innovative Learning). From industry visits, students can clearly understand the role of ICT in various types of organizations, e.g., ICT as the core business of organizations or ICT as a business enabler. In addition, students can identify the requirements and job specifications for a career in ICT. |
| 4   | Industry talk          | Industry visit is an approach of work-based learning and is a part of NALI (New Academic Innovative Learning). From industry talks, students can clearly understand the role of ICT in various types of organizations and current trends in the industry, such as IR4.0, blockchain. In addition, students can identify the requirements and job specifications for a career in ICT. |
| 5   | Lab work               | Students are required to assemble and reassemble computer hardware, and this lab work will be done in small groups. |
