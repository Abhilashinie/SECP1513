| 1 | Assignment 1/Poster | From this career talk, I have come to realize that a strong academic record isn't the sole determinant of future success. It's equally essential to possess practical skills and hands-on experience in your field of work. Of course, maintaining a high GPA is crucial as it serves as evidence of a solid foundational knowledge. Additionally, consistent communication with team members during assignments or projects is vital to hone effective communication skills. Mastering this skill opens up more opportunities to work in our preferred fields. | 
| 2 | Assignment 2/Video | This assignment provided a genuinely comfortable and relaxing experience, allowing me to capture the joy and excitement of my industry visit to UTM in a video. It also afforded me the opportunity to learn video editing techniques using Davinci Resolve alongside my group members. Through this industry visit, I gained valuable insights into the workings of UTM Digital's infrastructure, offering a glimpse into my potential future workplace.

This experience has helped me better understand the practical aspects of what I've learned in this course, moving beyond theoretical knowledge. I'm grateful for the chance to explore and comprehend the operations of a data center, witnessing the functions that contribute to making our university life more comfortable. This activity has further solidified my pride in choosing computer science as my degree program.

In conclusion, I find great encouragement in the idea of organizing similar visits, combining hands-on experiences with theoretical teachings. This approach adds a touch of excitement to academic life, ensuring it is not only informative but also enjoyable. |
