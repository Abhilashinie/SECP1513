| 1 | Assignment 1/Poster | From this career talk, I have come to realize that a strong academic record isn't the sole determinant of future success. It's equally essential to possess practical skills and hands-on experience in your field of work. Of course, maintaining a high GPA is crucial as it serves as evidence of a solid foundational knowledge. Additionally, consistent communication with team members during assignments or projects is vital to hone effective communication skills. Mastering this skill opens up more opportunities to work in our preferred fields. | 
| 2 | Assignment 2/Video | This assignment, involving a video documenting my UTM industry visit, was both enjoyable and instructive. I learned video editing using Davinci Resolve and gained insights into UTM Digital's infrastructure, offering a glimpse into my potential future workplace. It reinforced my pride in choosing computer science and inspired the idea of combining such visits with class theory for a more engaging academic experience. |
