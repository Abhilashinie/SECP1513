| 1 | Assignment 1/Poster | The Charity Techworks industrial talk on ICT jobs left me with valuable insights into the dynamic world of technology careers. Learning about diverse roles like Android development, Blockchain specialization, and QA testing expanded my understanding of the vast opportunities within the ICT sector. Witnessing Charity Techworks' innovative products, particularly "Rapid Pay," underscored the transformative impact of technology in reshaping financial ecosystems, inspiring me to consider the evolving landscape of fintech for future career exploration.| 
| 2 | Assignment 2/Video | My goal is to have a great understanding in various technologies and information systems. By studying this course, I can learn all the related knowledge by lectures and industry visits.
During this design thinking, we have learned about how a product is developed by design thinking phases. We have also learned about how to write a report, produce a high quality video and also present our product. The thing I learned in design thinking had a great impact on my dream to become a successful developer.
In order to improve my potential in the industry, besides to strengthen my professional knowledge, I will also make an effort in improving my soft skills such as communication skills, leadership skills, computer literacy, etc. For example, I will involve myself in leadership roles such as president in club, or group leader in assignments to practise how to lead a team.

| 3 | Assignment 3/Report | The industry talk left a lasting impression on me, especially regarding post-graduation life. The speaker's ability to navigate her career path post-graduation served as a warning, prompting me to prepare during my four years of education. Firstly, I aim to master basic information and understand the campus system thoroughly. I plan to engage in hands-on projects from lecturers, seek recommendations for external projects from seniors, and avoid solely relying on theoretical knowledge. Additionally, I intend to work as a lecturer's assistant part-time, using this opportunity to reinforce my understanding while teaching. In my final year, I plan to intern at iFast Capital, a software engineering company, as I believe this experience will significantly enhance my problem-solving skills. These strategic steps form my approach over the next four years to successfully transition into a system developer role. |
