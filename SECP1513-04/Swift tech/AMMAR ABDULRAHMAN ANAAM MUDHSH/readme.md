| 1 | Assignment 1/Poster | This talk served as a reminder that theoretical knowledge alone is not the sole determining factor when applying for positions in the computer science industry. I now understand that actively engaging in projects and emphasizing teamwork are crucial steps to prepare myself and enhance my chances of securing a position after graduation.|
| 2 | Assignment 2/Video | During the industrial visit to UTM Digital, I had the opportunity to explore various workspaces and understand the diverse roles within the industry. I observed that each role demanded a specific type of workspace tailored to its requirements. The insights into server maintenance and the stringent security measures in place were particularly fascinating. Moreover, I gained hands-on experience in video editing and learned to incorporate voiceovers. https://drive.google.com/file/d/19CXT6zDv0II_Y_acRiDPgoLa8tQnA-wt/view?usp=drivesdk (Our video)|
| 3 | Assignment 3/Report | This talk has given me insightful ideas for the future, ranging from taking internships to understanding the role I can play in system development. I am particularly interested in the role of a data architect in system development. To reach that position, I plan to work diligently on data-related subjects such as databases. Additionally, I intend to undertake projects related to data handling, coding, and database design.|
| 4 | Assignment 4/Newsletter | This industrial visit was very enlightening. I was able to see the different departments in a system development company and how each department interacts with the other. I first saw the web application development team comprising of frontend and backend developers where they depend on the UI/UX team for the design. The end product is then tested by the QA team. This process is also true for both the iOS and Android development teams. They also showed us that recreation is as important when doing a project; their recreational room was great with both digital and physical entertainment apparatus. Overall, I really enjoyed that visit and I hope I can do one of my internships there.|
| 5 | Quiz/PC Assemble | The PC assembly was a great hands-on experience. I was able to identify many of the components, including the Power Supply Unit (PSU), Random Access Memory (RAM), Hard Disk Drive (HDD), and the Central Processing Unit (CPU). Although we couldn't remove the CPU due to its sensitivity, we successfully removed all the other components and examined them closely. We also had a race to see who could assemble the PC first. After completing the assembly, we realized we forgot a cable, which unfortunately set us back. The quiz was based on the PC assembly steps, making it straightforward.|
