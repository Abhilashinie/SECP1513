| 4 | Assignment 4/Newsletter | This project introduces me to a new writing format—newsletters—that I had never heard of before. I was requested to write about my visit to Clarity Techworks and my experiences there for the newsletter. This task has truly tested my writing and creative abilities. Given that most software developers lack both talents, I believe having both of them will be crucial to my career as a software developer. |
| 5 | Quiz/PC Assemble | This activity has been incredibly helpful to me as a novice in IT knowledge because it has taught me the basics of PC components and how to install and uninstall them. My curiosity in PC customization is piqued by these activities, which could come in handy when I attempt to construct my own customized PC. |
