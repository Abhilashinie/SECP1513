| 1 | Assignment 1/Poster | As part of the first assignment, I had to make a poster on the virtual talk that took place. The virtual discussion involves Clarity Techworks, a company. I get to discover a lot of fresh information about teammates via this task. Since we will be working together on future assignments, I intend to build a friendship with them. Since I've completed a lot of posters in the past, the first job is really simple overall. | 
| 2 | Assignment 2/Video | My teammates and I were given the responsibility of creating a Vlog film about our visit to UTMDigital for the second assignment. Being camera shy, I find it very difficult to perform in front of the camera, but I feel more at ease in front of the camera now that I've forged friendships with my teammates. Even though I didn't contribute much to the editing process, my teammates taught me a lot of new editing techniques. As a result, we come out with this video : https://drive.google.com/file/d/107KGWfxdE1pOuQZz7EijTUsEjs5Tp1Zc/view?usp=drive_link | 
| 3 | Assignment 3/Report | I had to write a report on industrial talk for the third assignment. That industrial talk is about Credence's System Development. I am learning about Credence, a TM's business that specializes in cloud and digital services, thanks to this work. I also get to learn a lot of fresh information regarding data analysis and system development. |
| 4 | Assignment 4/Newsletter | This project introduces me to a new writing format—newsletters—that I had never heard of before. I was requested to write about my visit to Clarity Techworks and my experiences there for the newsletter. This task has truly tested my writing and creative abilities. Given that most software developers lack both talents, I believe having both of them will be crucial to my career as a software developer. |
| 5 | Quiz/PC Assemble | This activity has been incredibly helpful to me as a novice in IT knowledge because it has taught me the basics of PC components and how to install and uninstall them. My curiosity in PC customization is piqued by these activities, which could come in handy when I attempt to construct my own customized PC. |
