| 1 | Assignment 1/Poster | The first assignment given was to design a poster about a virtual industrial talk in Clarity Techworks. It was relatively easy for me since I've finished a lot of posters in the past, so the first task is straightforward in general. For our teamwork, as it was our first group assignment, we managed to work as a unit, even though this was our first time being together as a group.  | 
| 2 | Assignment 2/Video | Making a VLOG to UTM Digital was our second assignment, it was a very interesting activity for me as I hadn't gotten a chance to visit it. During this assignment, I found it hard for me to take good videos as I didnâ€™t have any chance to learn them. But, with my friend's help, I managed to improve a little bit by being a cameraman and increasing my video editing skills.
