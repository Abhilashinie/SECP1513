| 3 | Assignment 3/Report | I never heard about Credence before, and the next thing I know is that it is the TM subsidiary. I learn about how a system is developed with required skills so that I could compete to get my dream career. | 
| 4 | Assignment 4/Newsletter | The best activity yet memorable, I experienced the workplace and job scope in each section I visited. I also learned what each language does to create a website and application. The work environment were very calm with a room to relax and play games which I would love to work there if there are chances for me. |
| 5 | Quiz/PC Assemble | One of my favourite, everyone gives their best to remember the connection of PC components and try to assemble while competing with other groups. I learn the importance of RAM connection, which will cause the PC not to start up if the connection is not correct. Since, it is a memorable activity I manage to answer the quiz flawlessly. |
