| 1 | Assignment 1/Poster | The first assignment, everyone was still in great energy and give commitment. Every task divided was done flawlessly. I managed to design the poster together with group members while get to know about the Clarity Techworks, which I never heard before. | 
| 2 | Assignment 2/Video | VLOG to UTM Digital, one of the interesting activity in this course. I give out my best to record the best angle to keep the video aesthetic, which I love to. Then, I managed to edit the video where I not really good at it, but the assignment and comments from the YouTube helped me to improve my video editing skills. | 
| 3 | Assignment 3/Report | I never heard about Credence before, and the next thing I know is that it is the TM subsidiary. I learn about how a system is developed with required skills so that I could compete to get my dream career. | 
| 4 | Assignment 4/Newsletter | Reflection 4 |
| 5 | Quiz/PC Assemble | One of my favourite, everyone gives their best to remember the connection of PC components and try to assemble while competing with other groups. I learn the importance of RAM connection, which will cause the PC not to start up if the connection is not correct. Since, it is a memorable activity I manage to answer the quiz flawlessly. |
