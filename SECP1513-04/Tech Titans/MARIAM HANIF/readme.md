Assignment 1/Poster: The Clarity Techworks Sdn. Bhd. talk was super helpful for my computer science studies. It showed me the different paths I can take as a software engineering student, like being an Android Developer, QA Analyst, UI/UX Designer, or Web/API Developer. They also gave tips on the skills and tech stuff I need for these jobs and how to prep for a career in the field.

Assignment 2/Video: This one had a talk from UTM Digital and a visit to their place. The talk filled me in on what UTM Digital does and broadened my view of the IT field. The visit was cool, my first time there, and I got to see their fancy tech. They showed us around the office, digital care, data center, and even introduced us to their partners like Telekom Malaysia and Ruckus. Seeing how serious they are about quality and keeping data safe really stuck with me.

Assignment 3/Report: Ms. Qistina's talk on being a data analyst at Credence covered a lot. It got me thinking about becoming a flexible system developer. She stressed keeping up with new tech, always learning, and being good at teamwork and communication. Those are my main takeaways for getting better at my job.

Assignment 4/Newsletter: Before this, I didn't know much about IT. The industrial visit changed that and made me more interested in the field. It showed me what different jobs involve and how things work in an IT company. Learning about different technologies for different tasks gives me a good head start for my future career.

PC Assemble: Assembling a PC was cool â€“ my first time messing with computer hardware. Doing hands-on stuff like putting together the PC case, cables, power supply, RAM, HDD, and CPU fan was super helpful. It made it clear how important it is for us computer science students to know about both hardware and software.

Design Thinking Project: The AI project wasn't just about ideas. It taught me a lot, not just about AI but also how to think critically, communicate better, work in a team, and solve problems. These skills will be super useful as I aim to be a software engineer who not only codes well but also finds good solutions for clients. Moreover, as my team chose a topic fully related to Health-Care, which is very sensitive in the sense when it comes to implementing AI in it I got the exposure of the importance of thinking critically at the same time sensibly when it comes to using AI in our life.
