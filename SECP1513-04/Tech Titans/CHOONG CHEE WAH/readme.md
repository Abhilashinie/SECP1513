| 5 | Quiz/PC Assemble | The task of assembling the desktop host provided me with a hands-on learning opportunity.

The most exciting part was connecting the assembled console to the monitor for testing, which not only tested my assembly skills, but also allowed me to experience firsthand the sense of accomplishment of completing an actual task. This assignment not only enhanced my hardware knowledge, but also developed my problem-solving and teamwork skills. |
