Reflecting on the industry trends highlighted in the talk, I find myself reevaluating my path towards becoming a system developer in the next four years. This has prompted me to rethink my approach to excel in this field. My primary insight is the necessity of adapting to new software, recognizing the ever-evolving nature of computer science. To facilitate this, I am considering self-directed learning through various online resources like Udemy. Additionally, I plan to tackle a wide range of programming challenges to sharpen my critical thinking abilities, as I believe this is a vital step in becoming a proficient system developer. Beyond technical skills, I recognize the importance of enhancing interpersonal abilities such as communication, given the collaborative nature of most roles in this sector.

The task of assembling the desktop host provided me with a hands-on learning opportunity. The teacher patiently guided us in the process of disassembling and reassembling the computer host, which gave me a deeper understanding of the structure and function of the hardware. By assembling it myself, I gained a clearer understanding of the role of each part, which made me more confident when dealing with computer problems in the future. The most exciting part was connecting the assembled console to the monitor for testing, which not only tested my assembly skills, but also allowed me to experience firsthand the sense of accomplishment of completing an actual task. This assignment not only enhanced my hardware knowledge, but also developed my problem-solving and teamwork skills.
