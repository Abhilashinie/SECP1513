| 2 | Assignment 2/Video |We have an Industrial Visit to UTM DIGITAL and from this visit, the contents were both exciting and interesting for us. We have learned about UTM Digital not only made us realize the amount of work that goes behind providing and maintaining the digital services for UTM, it also opened our eyes to the goals and steps needed to further improve the system, and how our education, as well as the knowledge we gain from the course SECP 1513 (Technology and Information Systems) is crucial for this. Furthermore, the talk provided real world applications of the abstract ideas that we were exposed to during class in our SECP 1513 course. Overall, the activity was hugely beneficial and we believe that if there are future activities like this, it would deeply enrich our learning.                                                       https://youtu.be/LJbhXOpG3gg|

| 4 | Assignment 4/Newsletter |After visiting Clarity Techworks and being introduced to the many departments such as Web Application Team, User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX) Designer Team, Apllication Programming Interface(API) Team, Android Team, IOS Team and QA Analysts Team, I was able to learn a lot of things in regards to the technical field of ICT and a plethora of invaluable soft skills. We learnt that while an individual may be able to create things, but as a team we are able to create far greater things with higher efficiency and efficacy. The well-respected CTO Mr Yee detailed about the activities done in their company and how he leads his team in completing projects. He also gave a lot of advices which I valued a lot, the main one being to focus on gaining experience while working, especially as an entry-level worker. His point being that while money can bring you many things but experience can change your livelihood for the better.|
| 5 | Quiz/PC Assemble | From the PC assembly, not only was I able to learn the arrangment of each component as well as how to cable manage, I was also able to grasp the inner working of the PC and what each component was used for. I was also introduced to the steps in assembling and dissembling, which include opening the case, disconnecting the cables, taking out the power supply, taking out the RAM, taking out the HDD and taking out the CPU Fan. I was extremely amazed by the ingenuity of the PC and was deeply inspired to continue to pursue a career in IT.|
