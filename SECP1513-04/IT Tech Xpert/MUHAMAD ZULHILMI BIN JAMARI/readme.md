| 3 -Report | Industrial talk 1: System Development at Credence (subsidiary TM) | On December 28, 2023, I joined a Webex session discussing the development of Credence's system, and it was really eye-opening. I was amazed at the variety of tools they used and the dedication they put into building the system.

Each department took the time to explain their responsibilities and the skills needed for their roles.

It turned out to be a hands-on and interesting way to grasp how different parts work together to make a computer actually work.

The quiz made me remember how to link up the parts using cables so that everything stayed connected the right way. I'm happy I joined the PC assembly quiz because I learned what I needed to and it was really helpfu |
| 6-Project | Design thinking | We have divided our group with a specific task at first but then we have changed our mind to do it together as this is a group work assignment and not an individual task. Besides, we can help each other in completing our assignments. We thought that we can get better results by being cooperative in this assignment and helping each other .From the prototype we created, we found that it is hard to build up a new system  as there are a lot of existing systems in the world that are performing well. We must also help in modifying the existing system to reduce the resources used and be able to help the community to solve their problem efficiently..
