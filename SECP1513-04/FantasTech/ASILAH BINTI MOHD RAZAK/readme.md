|1|Assignment 1/Poster|The industrial talk by Clarity Techworks Sdn. Bhd. was really interesting and it gives a significant advantage for me as a student of computer science. They shared the career path of a software engineering student, introducing various job opportunities such as Android Developer, QA Analyst, UI/UX Designer and Web/API developer. They also discussed the required skills, technologies and offered some advices for us to prepare before entering the real industry.|
|2|Assignment 2/Video|Assignment 2 are divided into two activity. The first one is virtual talk by UTM Digital. From the talk, I learned a few previously unknown things about UTM Digital. They explained about their responsibility at UTM Digital and the services they provide. This has exposed me a lot in IT field working opportunities. The next one is industrial visit to UTM Digital, located opposite N24 block. It was my first time went there and it is really interesting as I could see upgraded technologies uses by UTM. We visited a few departments such as open office, digital care and the data center. I also got know UTMâ€™s collaborators such as Telekom Malaysia and Ruckus. It is a great experience to see the environment and getting exposed their service that aimed at maintaining high quality services for all UTM members. They also explained their security measures, particularly in dealing with confidential data. It makes me impressed and wanted to serve better in this industry.|
|3|Assignment 3/Report|The industrial talk by Ms Qistina exposed me to the job scope of a data analyst as she holds that position at Credence. In the next four years, I would aim to be a flexible and versatile system developer by stay updated with the latest technologies. I have to be more open in exploring new things and regularly upgrade my skills while working as a system developer as this field is evolving rapidly. I must be willing to have a continuous learning to stay relevant. I also plan to enhance my teamwork skills and sharpen my soft skills such as communications and confidence as advised by Ms. Qistina.|
|4|Assignment 4/Newsletter|As a person who joined IT course without doing much research, I believe that this enjoyable industrial visit has exposed me to the real IT industry and enhanced my interest in pursuing and acing this field of study. From this visit, I have learned a lot of new things such as responsibilities associated with different positions and a better understanding of the workflow in an IT company. I also have been exposed to different technologies for different purposes and it is a significant advantage for me as I prepare for the future.|
|5|Quiz/PC Assemble|This PC Assembly activity is really interesting for me as I never had the chance to do it elsewhere. I had the opportunity to observe and learn how to assemble and reassemble a PC. The process involved opening the PC case, unplugging the cable, power supply, RAM, HDD and CPU fan. Then, we reassembled all the components and tested the computer. To be a versatile computer science student, I believe it is important to have knowledge of hardware component of a computer, not just good in software development such as coding.|
