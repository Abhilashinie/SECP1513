| ----- |  ------ | ----- | 
| **1 - POSTER** | *FanTastech Industrial Talk 1 - Assignment 1* | This poster showcases the Industrial Talk that Dr. Muhammad Iqbal Tariq arranged, at which speakers from Clarity Techworks were invited to talk about ICT careers. Although the discussion was really informative, the thing that really struck a chord with me was that employers are more interested in hiring people who have experience creating a variety of projects and who have demonstrated their problem-solving abilities than in people with high GPAs. | 
| **2 - VIDEO** | *FantasTech Industrial Visit 1 - Assignment 2* | [Video link](https://youtu.be/tCT9Sbe8C_8)<br> IHere we visited UTM Digital with Dr. Muhamad Iqbal and I found this visit to be very interesting.| 
| **3 - REPORT** | *FantasTech Industrial Talk 2 - Assignment 3* |After listening to Qistina Azman discuss her work in analytics, I'm motivated to pursue a career in system development. I admire the way she developed professionally. Credence, her workplace, has a laid-back, adaptable air that makes it sound cool. In the next four years, I want to constantly be learning new things, just like her. I want to become proficient at handling data and making it understandable, like Qistina suggested. I have discovered that different types of information are needed by different people in a firm, therefore I want to be helpful to everyone. All in all, her talk inspired me to continue learning, improve my technical skills, and contribute positively to teams.  | 
| **4-NEWSLETTER** |*FantasTech Assignment 4 Newsletter Clarity*  |My visit to CLARITY TECHWORKS provided me with a clear understanding of how a fintech company operates. I was aware of every specific task performed by every team, including frontend, backend, and styling, as well as the software and languages they employ. This visit, I think, inspired me to keep going and pursue software engineering as my major. Even though I want to work as a web developer, I think that in order to be a full-stack developer, one must have a foundational understanding of other domains. |
| **5 - QUIZ** | *PC Assemble* | Dr. Muhammad Iqbal Tariq split the students up into five groups that day to disassemble and then reassemble a desktop computer. The desktop cover, cables, battery, RAM, hard drive, and CPU fan had to be removed one after the other. After that, we were instructed to put the desktop back together and make sure it functioned when it was turned on. There would be rewards for the first group to finish. Though we weren't the fastest, our desktop was functional. This exercise really helped me learn about the insides of a desktop.|
| **6 - Phase 2** | *FantasTech Phase 2 Design Thinking Information Gathering & Analysis*| Our ability to conduct surveys and conduct interviews was invaluable for this report's practical application. Such skills are essential for positions that need information collection.|
| **7 - Proposal** | *Plagiarism Detection Proposal (FantasTech)* | This idea taught me that doctors are people too, just like the rest of us. I was hesitant to approach them for an interview because I imagined them to be some sort of superior human being. I discovered that doctors are incredibly kind after speaking with Dr. Alif Ridzuan. Dr. Alif conducted the interview with us and was incredibly kind, giving us all the information we required! I also gained knowledge about group work.|
| **8 - Final Report** | *FantasTech Project Design Thinking Report* | 1. What is your goal/dream with regard to your course/program? During my studies, I hope to focus on web development.

My goal is to play a part in creating a digital environment where websites are not only useful but also aesthetically beautiful and easy to use.2. How does this specialization impact on your goal/dream with regard to your program? My program's specialization in web development enables me to fully immerse myself in the dynamic field of web technology. In order to make sure that the websites and applications I develop are both technically sound and user-centric, design thinking becomes an essential part of my workflow.3. What is the action/improvement/plan necessary for you to improve your potential in the industry? I intend to keep up with the most recent developments in web technologies, frameworks, and design trends in order to maximize my potential in the web development field. My abilities will be improved by actively participating in coding projects, working with others, and getting feedback. Engaging in web development forums, going to pertinent workshops, and developing a solid online portfolio will all help me establish my credibility and lead to interesting career options. |
