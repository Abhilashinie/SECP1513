Reflection

It was a great experience to do this project with my fellow classmates. This was the first time I had to work with a team through so many stages of the project. It was a satisfying experience to see each of the phases getting completed and seeing our various ideas coming together and solidifying. Through this project I had to do a lot of teamwork, and it was great to see how the seemingly difficult tasks became easier when we all broke it down and attempted it together. The design thinking process gave me a glimpse into how to develop app interfaces keeping the users in mind.
