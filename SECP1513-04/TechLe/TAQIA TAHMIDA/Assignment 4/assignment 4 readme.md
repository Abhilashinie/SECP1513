## Assignment 4 Reflection
The industry tour this time was a great way to show us students how our workplaces might look if we succeed in securing jobs in this sector. We got first hand detailed experience on what kind of work we would be expected to do and got valuable advice from industry seniors on how to improve ourselves and stand out in this industry. Moreover, I feel like this visit rekindled the passion inside me to become a skilled programmer and challenge myself.
