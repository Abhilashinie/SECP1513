This is a video we made after our visit to UTM Digital, where we were shown around the different divisions and got to communicate with the people working there and get to experience the work environment of this industry. Before the visit, we had a webinar hosted by the UTM Digital so we were even more looking forward to the visit. Getting to interview the people there was enlightening. The most interesting part was visiting the data center where we were not allowed to take any pictures. It was amazing to hear about the many different security measures and precautions taken to keep the system running smoothly.
