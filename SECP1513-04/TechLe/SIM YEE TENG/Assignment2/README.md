 <p>This time we are so gald to have a chance to visit the digital Center in UTM. For more details, Digital Center UTM acts as a core of wifi in the whole UTM. In the center, what amaze me the most is the data center but as it does not allow filming, we do not have any picture regarding it. The data center is very important to UTM as it provides big data and data analysis to the whole UTM.</p>
<p>Through interview with the staff there, we are amaze of the way they solve every problem as it is very systematic and efficient. For more details, they have 3 levels. Level 0 is the testing stage, proceed to level 1 which is the technical team and at last level 2 which involve person in charge with all technical problem. </p>
<p>The staffs also give us some advise, she hopes that we can have challenge bravely as we might face different and new challange everyday due to the improving of technology. Due to the speedy improving of technology, we must study for the new technology everyday so that we can develop apps or system which is efficient and fulfilled users' demand. </p>
