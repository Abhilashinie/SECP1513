#Design thinking
<p>For our design thinking, we have gotten the topic of cybersecurity and we have been doing research on scam call app. After that we have successfully got ideas to modify the app. We have add in new features such as voice changing feature and ip tracking mechanism. <p/>
<p>As for my reflection, from my point of view, by doing this design thinking, we have known the importance
 of fulfill user's request. By achieving user's request,we can have a better app compare to the
 existing one. Besides, we have known the importance of doing surveys by comparing the
 features with other existing apps before developing an app as the survey will make our app
 special and the users may want to try our app's new feature. This project also taught us that every
 app developed is to help the user and make technology useful to the future .</p>
