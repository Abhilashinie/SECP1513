PC Assemble Lab:
The PC Assemble & Disassemble Lab was a hands-on experience that allowed me to play around with different PC parts
and work in a group to assemble and disassemble the various parts. It was an enjoyable interactive experience. 

Assignment 1 (Poster):
From our Industry Talk 1 with Clarity Techworks I have learned that to work in the tech field you not only have to be well-versed in using 
various software, but also have soft skills to help you succeed in your role. I also got the opportunity to learn the various types of jobs 
available at Clarity Techworks and the tech field. Hearing Ms. Liyana Amri talk about her position as a QA Tester was fascinating. It
was a new field in technology I learned about and would personally enjoy working in. 

Assignment 2 (Video): 
For our second assignment, we got to film our experience visiting UTM Digital. 
We not only got to learn about the many services offered by UTM Digital but also got to visit the data center which we could not film. 
It was a thrilling experience since UTM Digital also allowed us to experience what it was like to work in the technology industry. 
Visiting around the offices, seeing the various technologies available (such as the interactive whiteboard), and interacting with various 
members of the UTM Digital team were fascinating. 

Assignment 3 (Report):
Ms. Qistina’s industrial talk provided valuable advice and direction on how to become a skilled developer. Through the online talk, I gained
insights on the journey of credence and its role in meeting marketing demands. The talk, not only opened a possible career opportunity for
me in systems development, but also encouraged me to stay up-to-date with the knowledge I acquired in the technological field up to
date tools and constantly improving the programming languages I learn.

Assignment 4 (Newsletter):
The industry tour to Clarity Techworks was an interesting and eye-opening experience as I got to see firsthand what it was like to work in 
the technology industry. Of course, there are videos about work experiences but getting an in-person experience was much more helpful. The 
opportunity to interact and network with different types of developers led me to think of a possible future as a QA Analyst, 
UI/ UX Designer, front-end web developer, or iOS developer. Mr. Yee Soon Tuck’s wise words,  “Programmers can do anything,” truly 
inspired me to work harder as a future developer. 

Design Thinking Project: 
The course and the design thinking project helped me to get an inkling of what a possible career path as a software engineer could look like. The goal of the project was to create
a product that was different from existing products in the industry while also being able to tackle the issue that was presented to us. 
As an incoming software engineer, I realized that the end goal is not always creating an app that is different from others but creating an 
app that constantly improves on others' work and keeps up with new challenges that are arising. The project helped me to be a critical 
thinker and leader along with giving me an understanding to see the threat from a user's point of view. However, improvements are always 
necessary and I think there are some that our product could go through such as connecting it with a security system that could catch the scam 
callers.
