I am very happy to visit Clarity Techworks because it was an eye-opening and valuable experience for me. They have several teams which collaborate well and they love their jobs. It inspired me that collaboration and creativity are at the heart of their success. This visit not only deepened my understanding for the technology industry but also make me tend to explore more about technology and future.The advanced technologies and showcased during the visit impressed me alot. The teams demonstrated and showcased how they work. We have a deeper understanding on each team's jobscope, such as UI/UX Analyst, API team, Android Developer Team and iOS team. We also had a chance to play some simple games which are prepared by the teams. Moreover, interacting with professionals working in different departments provided valuable insights and make me more understand how a technology company works. The visit broadened my thoughts and make me wanted to know more about them.  I appreciate this valuable chance given by our lecturer to visit Clarity Techworks. I hope I would have more chances to visit industries in the future.
