# Design Thinking
Our project is an anti scam call app called ScamKiller. We have done some survey before starting our project. We have also interviewed experienced people. Therefore, we have produced a prototype of our app. Do take a look!

Taking part in this group project has been a valuable and interesting experience. I have more opportunities to collaborate with different respondents and team members to enhance mycommunication skills. Our team members contributed fairly, which made the tasks to be done efficiently. I appreciate the strengths each member has and the collaboration that made our project done successfully. I aim to apply the lessons learned in this project, especially communication skills and design thinking skills in my future. To sum up, this experience has not only contributed to my academic knowledge but has also enriched my understanding of teamwork and collaboration.
