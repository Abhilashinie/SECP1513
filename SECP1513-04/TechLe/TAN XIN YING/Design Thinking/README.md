I aim to apply the lessons learned in this project, especially communication skills and design thinking skills in my future. I am also acknowledge and know deeper about the technologies in calling apps while doing research for our design thinking porject. To sum up, this experience has not only contributed to my academic knowledge but has also enriched my understanding of teamwork and collaboration.
