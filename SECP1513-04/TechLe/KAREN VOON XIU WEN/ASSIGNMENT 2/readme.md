# ASSIGNMENT 2-VIDEO
Reflection:

On 14th December, our section had visited UTM Digital in UTM, it was a fun and memorable experience for me. We had a chance to visit their workplace and we manage to interview the staff to get more information about the place. The staffs are friendly and they answer our question patiently. Other than that, we also get to visit the database in UTM Digital. It was a golden opportunity for us to see how the data store inside the database.
