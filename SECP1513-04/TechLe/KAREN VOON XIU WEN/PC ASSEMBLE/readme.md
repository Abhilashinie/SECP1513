# PC ASSEMBLE

REFLECTION:

On 2nd November 2023, our section had conducted a PC assemble in N28. I had learned how to assemble and dissemble a computer case correctly. Besides, I also got to know the proper name of different component in the computer case. During the session, lecturers and assistants help us a lot by telling us how to take out the components correctly and what should we pay attention on. At the end, all of the group manage to dissemble and reassemble the computer case.
