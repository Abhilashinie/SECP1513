#DESIGN THINKING PROJECT -SCAM KILLER

REFLECTION:

During the starting phase, I felt that the design thinking project is a heavy project for us and we need to spend a lot of effort on this design thinking project. After we had done the design thinking assignment, I realize that the project is easier than I think when we work in group and cooperate well with each other. This project required creative thinking skill and it also train us to work in group. I think this indeed helps a lot in our future.
