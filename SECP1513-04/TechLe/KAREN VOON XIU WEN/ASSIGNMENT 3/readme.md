# ASSIGNMENT 3-INDUSTRY TALK 2

REFLECTION:

In this industry talk 2, I had got a lot of information and advice from Ms Qistina, she is a system developer in TM. I also get to know the possible job opportunity in system development field. Besides, I also learn about what technologies and tools they are using. For example, they use PostgreSQL to develop a database engine and closely related components. System developer is a job that required continuous learning, I hope I can be like Ms Qistina in the future.
