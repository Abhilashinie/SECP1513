| 5 | Quiz/PC Assemble | Reflection Quiz <br>The experience of assembling and reassembling the PC amazed me, especially as it was my first time doing it. It is so different from watching the assembly video from Youtube and assemble it myself using my hands. It also remind me to be patient no matter what i do because i accidentally assemble the wrong side of the fan at the beginning and it didnt work when we want to open the PC! Luckily, we did a good teamwork and successfully solve the problem and the PC is running!</br><br> <a href="https://github.com/miqbaltariq/SECP1513/tree/main/SECP1513-04/TechLe/CHANG WEI LAM/Quiz PC Assemble" > <img src="https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/blob/main/project/project/sec01/curiousity/img/document1.png?raw=true" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
