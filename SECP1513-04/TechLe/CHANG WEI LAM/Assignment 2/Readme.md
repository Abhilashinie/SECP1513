# Reflection 
<br> Through this virtual talk and industry visit to UTM Digital, I have clearly understand that UTM Digital center not only provide wifi services, while it provide a lot of data infrastructure services and data management. Myutm website,apps and Student Portal also under their management. They play the important role on maintaining the stability and security of the data. When we visit the digital center, they welcomed us friendly and willing to share us the info about UTM Digital. The staff brought us walking through the open space office, meeting room and the most private and security, data center of UTM. I felt impress while looking at the data center as it just like the secret data storing places that i watch from the movie. It was a good eye-expanding experience for me!
