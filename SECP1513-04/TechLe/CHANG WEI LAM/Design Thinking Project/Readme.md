# Design Thinking Project
<br>  Participating in this project let me learn about the process of developing an application and solving the client's problems to meet their needs. I clearly understand that teamwork is crucial in design thinking projects. I appreciate my teammates who put a lot of effort into this project. Good teamwork is essential from the beginning to the end for developing a useful application. Additionally, I also appreciate the help from Dr. Iqbal, who gave us advice and opinions about the scam call features. I will take it as an inspiration for me to become a software developer and improve myself from time to time. </br>
