We deassembled the PC first and then check all the components, such as- hard disk, RAM, cooling fan, processor, power unit etc. After that, we assembled the PC again and power it on. As the PC started properly, we assembled all the components correctly. Lastly, we attended a quiz which helped us to check our understandings of the components in a PC. |
