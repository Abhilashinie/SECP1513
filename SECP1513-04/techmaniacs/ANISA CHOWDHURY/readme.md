The seminar provided me with numerous excellent insights. The session helped me better understand current technological developments, workplace difficulties, and future potentials needed. The following speakers attended this industrial talk: Mr. Yee, Chief Technology Officer, Ms. Liyana, QA Testing Analyst, Ms. Syarifah, Junior UI/UX Designer, Mr. Ridwan, Junior Android Developer, and Ms. Izzah and Mr. Saiful, both Junior Web Developers and UTM alumni. Mr. Yee shared his real-world expertise with us, which is really valuable to all of us. The speakers emphasised the rapid pace of technological innovation and the need for professionals to adapt to these changes. As a result, we prioritise ongoing learning and skill development. Afterward, we shared our thoughts on a poster. This experience taught me about making posters and using Canva. |

Later, we had the opportunity to physically visit UTMDigital. The industrial visit was an interesting and beneficial learning opportunity. During the tour, I learned and understood how UTM Digital works, as well as the staff's workplace. The workplace is well-organized, and the employees are so friendly. The discussions with professionals at the UTM digital proved helpful. Their enthusiasm for their job and pleasure in contributing to the UTM Digital motivated me tremendously. The staff invited us to visit their centre, where we saw the Digital Care Centre, Data Centre, open office, and meeting rooms named after their partners. The visit aroused my interest in the industry's future trends and advancements. I hope I get more opportunities to attend industrial trips in the future because it truly helps in my understanding on the operation of an industry. | 
| **3 - Report** | *Industrial Talk-2<br>System Development @Credence* | [Report](https://github.com/miqbaltariq/SECP1513/blob/main/SECP1513-04/techmaniacs/ANISA%20CHOWDHURY/Assignment-3%20Report.pdf)<br>In this talk, Mrs. Qistina explained to us what is analytics, various career options in this field, the tools and technologies they use everday. She also shared the workspace culture of Crecedence with us. This talk  made me realise the value of passion and purpose in a profession. It has also encouraged me to be proactive in learning new things. Networking is essential, and I now understand the importance of developing genuine professional ties. Overall, the discussion has encouraged me to approach my job with enthusiasm and a commitment to lifelong learning. I'm excited to utilise these teachings as I embark on my own career adventure.

| **4- Newsletter** | *Industrial Visit-2<br>Clarity Techworks SDN BHD* | [Newsletter](https://github.com/miqbaltariq/SECP1513/blob/main/SECP1513-04/techmaniacs/ANISA%20CHOWDHURY/Assignment04-Newsletter.pdf)<br>Visiting Clarity Techworks was an eye-openeing thrilling experience. This tour not only increased my admiration for the tech world, but also piqued my interest in learning more and considering a future career in technology. After our visit to Clarity Techworks, I was struck with astonishment and inspiration. It was quite evident that the organisation promoted a culture of thinking outside the box and pushing the limits of what is possible.Finally, the industrial tour to Clarity Techworks was a fascinating and enriching experience. It has not only improved my understandings and knowledge of the IT world, but also piqued my enthusiasm. |
| **5 - Quiz** | *PC Assemble Lab & Quiz* | The PC assemble lab activity was a valuable learning experience that provided me with a practical understanding of computer hardware components. The lab's major goal was to disassamble a completely functional PC to various components and then reassemble it. I now have a thorough understanding of the roles of various hardware components, as well as the step-by-step procedure for assembling and disassembling a computer.We were divided in a group of 5 to do the lab activity. We deassembled the PC first and then checked all the components within the CPU, such as- hard disk, RAM, cooling fan, processor, power unit etc. After that, we assembled the PC again and power it on. As the PC started properly, we assembled all the components correctly. Lastly, we attended a quiz which helped us to check our understandings of the components in a PC. To summarise, the PC assemble lab was a valuable experience that bridged the gap between theory and reality. I hope to have more opportunities to attend such lab activities in the near future. |
