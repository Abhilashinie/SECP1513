| **1 - POSTER** | *Industrial Talk-1<br>Overview of ICT Jobs in Clarity Techworks* | Got an exposure of the Malaysian tech industry for the first time through this talk. We got to discover different jobs and the skills needed for them. Afterward, we shared our thoughts on a poster. This experience taught me about making posters and using Canva. | 
| **2 - VIDEO** | *Virtual Talk on "UTMDigital- our Digital University Driver"<br>Visit To UTMDigital* | [Video link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dDFoLoXUEoc9mpdpDdKMQQEs3vR-gZ7C/view)<br> Before our visit to UTM Digital, we attended a virtual talk where we got a brief understanding of UTMDigital. Later, we had the opportunity to physically visit UTMDigital. During the visit, we learned about the work environment, the functioning of UTMDigital, and its significant role in UTM. We also had conversations with people working there who were very friendly and shared their work experiences with us. |
