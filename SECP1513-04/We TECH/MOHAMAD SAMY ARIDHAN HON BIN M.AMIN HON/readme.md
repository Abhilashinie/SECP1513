| 3 | Assignment 3/Report | Reflection 3 <br> After hearing this talk, I have understood what analytics is and why it plays a crucial role in the work field. The fact that almost everything around us is the results of analytics is fascinating to me and it opens my eyes once I realize how big of an impact it can have on the world. Before this talk, I've never heard of analytics, let alone being interested in it. But now, thanks to the industry talk, I've developed interest in this career and it is a potential career path for me that I would never know about otherwise. I'm thankful to UTM for giving me and other students the opportunity to get exposure on the real work field even when I'm still year 1. |
