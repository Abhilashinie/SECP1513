| 2 | Assignment 2/Video | Reflection 2 <br> The industry visit was a good pace change with course mates after studying all week. Not only did we have fun exploring, we also gained knowledge of what it’s like in an IT working office. <br> This activity is highly beneficial to me as I have never experienced exploring an office like UTM digital. It has sparked motivation in me to work hard so that I will get into a nice office environment and culture like this. Not only that, the features and new technologies I have never seen before in the office have given me inspirations, and also better insights on what potential career paths I can take in the future. <br> I wasn’t too interested in this subject before but after experiencing Industry Visit 1, I find myself looking forward to this subject more because of the activities or assignments it offers that aren’t as mundane as other courses, it is practical and exciting. I hope I can learn more by having fun in similar courses in the future. <br> Video Link <br> https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Dq5C8PDExWydHJ8A3ihGCFXFyW6USKns?usp=sharing | 
| 3 | Assignment 3/Report | Reflection 3 <br> After hearing this talk, I have understood what analytics is and why it plays a crucial role in the work field. The fact that almost everything around us is the results of analytics is fascinating to me and it opens my eyes once I realize how big of an impact it can have on the world. Before this talk, I've never heard of analytics, let alone being interested in it. But now, thanks to the industry talk, I've developed interest in this career and it is a potential career path for me that I would never know about otherwise. I'm thankful to UTM for giving me and other students the opportunity to get exposure on the real work field even when I'm still year 1. |
