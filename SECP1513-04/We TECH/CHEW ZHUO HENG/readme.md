This talk gives me a view of the career opportunity that I might involve in after 4 years of study in UTM. The tips given by Ms.Qistina definitely get me on the right track towards my goal, it will definitely be very useful for me in my next 4 years of study. I feel grateful to attend this talk when I am in my first year, it will play a huge role to impact me to be a better student. |
