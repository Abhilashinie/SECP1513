| 2 | Assignment 2/Video | Reflection 2 <br> The industry visit was a good pace change with course mates after studying all week. Not only did we have fun exploring, we also gained knowledge of what it’s like in an IT working office. <br> This activity is highly beneficial to me as I have never experienced exploring an office like UTM digital. It has sparked motivation in me to work hard so that I will get into a nice office environment and culture like this. Not only that, the features and new technologies I have never seen before in the office have given me inspirations, and also better insights on what potential career paths I can take in the future. <br> I wasn’t too interested in this subject before but after experiencing Industry Visit 1, I find myself looking forward to this subject more because of the activities or assignments it offers that aren’t as mundane as other courses, it is practical and exciting. I hope I can learn more by having fun in similar courses in the future. <br> Video Link <br> https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Dq5C8PDExWydHJ8A3ihGCFXFyW6USKns?usp=sharing | 
| 3 | Assignment 3/Report | Reflection 3 <br> After hearing this talk, I have understood what analytics is and why it plays a crucial role in the work field. The fact that almost everything around us is the results of analytics is fascinating to me and it opens my eyes once I realize how big of an impact it can have on the world. Before this talk, I've never heard of analytics, let alone being interested in it. But now, thanks to the industry talk, I've developed interest in this career and it is a potential career path for me that I would never know about otherwise. I'm thankful to UTM for giving me and other students the opportunity to get exposure on the real work field even when I'm still year 1. |

| 5 | Quiz/PC Assemble | Reflection Quiz <br> This activity is the one I am looking forward to the most since I have always been interested in PC building but never got experience with it. I am grateful to UTM for granting me this opportunity. I have learned a lot in this activity through the excellent explanation of Professors and assistants. Each step is explained in great details in both disassembling and assembling the PC. The small competition for groups that can assemble the PC at the end is especially fun. There was a quiz after the building session, but it wasn’t hard at all since explanations were given when we were building the PC. The quiz was a great way for me to recall and retain the information and knowledge I learned. I believe I would be able to do this personally in the future thanks to this great learning opportunity.|
| 6 | Design Thinking  | Reflection <br> My objective in this course is to get as much exposure as possible to the working field.  Unlike other courses that only teach theoretical knowledge, TIS encourages us to gain more practical knowledge by giving us opportunities to communicate with experts in the working field.<br>Doing this project has helped gain a lot of insights on the basic idea of developing a system by ourselves. This experience will help me build a stronger foundation when it comes to creating an app or website.<br>To maximize my potential, I have to be more proactive in participating in projects outside my curriculum. Experience is the most valuable thing I can get while still in college and it will help me get to where I want to.<br> Presentation Video Link <br> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u7DF6dh4vOf2Ze3YrfGYCclLSXrBy08M/view?usp=sharing |
