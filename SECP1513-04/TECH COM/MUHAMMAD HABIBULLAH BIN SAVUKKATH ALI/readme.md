I also need to get acquainted to the technology that the industry uses these days.This talk definitely has pulling my heart toward ICT world as i am now can see the future of me in this industry! I canâ€™t wait to see what will i become in the next coming years as a computer science student especially after hearing those golden advices and tips from Ms Qistina!  | 
| 4 | Assignment 4/Newsletter | The visit to Clarity Techworks was both joyful and educational. I now have a clear vision of the process of software development. I was able to see from the initial stage of the system implementation until the final stage before release ,it involves software developer until QA analyst. Not only that, I also gained the experience of the work life as i got the opportunity to engage in processes  such as coding, how to design the software, how to check the system before releases and much more. These experiences were really truly valuable in preparing me for the activities of the work life later on. |
| 5 | Quiz/PC Assemble | As a computer science major specializing in software engineering, it is not enough for me to be proficient in programming, coding, or software development; I also need to be well-versed in computer hardware.Therefore, in this PC Assembly, i have learnt how to reassemble and assemble PC. For instance, i now can take off the power supply, RAM, Fan and other parts also. As a result, I think this PC Assembly is incredibly beneficial for computer science students in order to produce high-quality employees. |
