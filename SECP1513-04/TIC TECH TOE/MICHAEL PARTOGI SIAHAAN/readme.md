| 1 | Assignment 1/Poster | From the industrial talk, we learnt that learning how to program does not stop when you leave university but it is a life long journey. We will always learn and discover new things about programming. Another point that struck us was when Mr. Ridwan said, “Each action must be held accountable”. This point kept reminding us that, in the workplace, nobody has the responsibility to teach you how to do things and the problems we're facing. Thus, every step and decision that we make has to be considered carefully. Besides, don't feel pressured if you don't get a job right away after graduation because a person with ability and talent will not be stifled. |

Having a good understanding and tolerance with each other is also important when working in teams. Be confident to take opportunities that are presented otherwise others will take it. | 
| 4 | Assignment 4/Newsletter | Visiting Clarity Techworks was an eye opening experience and a great learning opportunity because we get to meet experienced people in their own field and talk to them about their jobs. They also gave us many advice so we could improve ourselves. To conclude, we had a great time during our visit and it was a great experience learning from them. |
| 5 | Quiz/PC Assemble | After our PC Assembling lab, We learnt about the structure of PC.
