| 1 | Assignment 1/Poster | From the industrial talk, we learned that programming is not a course where we can use theknowledge we acquired at university for the rest of our lives. We have to learn on top of that byourselves, even when we step into work life already. Another point that struck us was the onepresented by Mr. Ridwan. He said, “Each action must be held accountable” . This point keepsreminding us that, in the workplace, nobody has the responsibility to solve the problems that wecause. Thus, every step and decision that we make has to be considered carefully, not only in worklife. Besides, don't feel pressured if you don't get a job right away after graduation because aperson with ability and talent will not be stifled. |
