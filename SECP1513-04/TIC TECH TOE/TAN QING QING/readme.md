| 3 | Assignment 3/Report | The speaker made me understand that, as a student who wants to become a system developer in the next four years, I must have the strength and determination to face my faults and difficulties while studying and at my internship, and I also must refrain from being scared to ask questions when I don't understand something. Not only that, but we need to grab all opportunities that occur; this will help us become more professional and effective. A variety of opportunities can assist us in improving our values. In addition, I discovered that I should never stop improving my communication skills. Good communication skills can help us handle various interpersonal connections more effectively and seek help when we face troubles |
