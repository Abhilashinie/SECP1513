| 1 | Assignment 1/Poster | Coding is a non-stop journey, once you start you have to keep going. Keep learning, keep updating, keep improving. University is a guide or user manual to let us start the game, what is the product is totally dependent on us. Everyone will get the same thing at the starting point. Some never start, but some already go far away and move towards their goal. Do not try to find an excuse for yourself to stop learning. |

| 3 | Assignment 3/Report | As the speaker said, she didnâ€™t just sit and wait for the spoon feeding from the boss. She curious everything and learn many thing in the internship in TM. This allowed her supervisor to see that she is a very potential worker. This very enlighten me to take action to discover new thing, not only sit there and curious. Beside that, from the talk I also learn that we have to improve ourselves and explore new things. As the speaker say that, in the future most of us will work in technology field and maybe today is one trend and tomorrow there will be another trend. Thus, we alway have to keep update ourselves with the trend | 
| 4 | Assignment 4/Newsletter |Clarity Techworks provide a very good opportunity for us university student to explore what will be our future carrier and allowed us to improved ourselves and move towards our target. Besides, after the talk from different department, we learnt that cooperative is very important in a team instead of just work alone.,1+1 is always greater than two. |
| 5 | Quiz/PC Assemble |From the PC Assemble we can learn about the structure of the PC we are using. We learn about the components inside the PC and their function. With this PC Assemble, we can touch and assemble the PC ourselves and this enables us to learn about the PC faster than just sitting in class and looking at the slides of the tutorail. |
| 6 | Design Thinking Project |From the process of doing Design Thinking, we learned that communication is the most important thing. Just like in our project, if we didn't communicate with the client, we wouldn't know what they need and what part we need to focus on in the design. We also need to get opinions from different people before we do anything. Different opinions allow us to have a broader vision and think from different perspectives. Just like after consulting Dr Iqbal, we realised that the ideas we were proposing were not mature enough and we could see our pros and cons.    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XZ7q_m9VGeYJ_lQzetsws1TDdIcyaAQb?usp=sharing  |
