curious everything and learn many thing in the internship in TM. This allowed her supervisor to
see that she is a very potential worker. This very enlighten me to take action to discover new
thing, not only sit there and curious. Beside that, from the talk I also learn that we have to
improve ourselves and explore new things. As the speaker say that, in the future most of us will
